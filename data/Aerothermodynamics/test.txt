COMPUTATIONAL AEROTHERMODYNAMICS
George S. Deiwert* and Michael J. Greent
Computational aerothermodynamics (CAT) has in the past
contributed to the understanding of real-gas flows encountered
by hypervelocity reentry vehicles. With advances in computational fluid dynamics, in the modeling of high-temperature
phenomena, and in computer capability, CAT is an enabling
technology for the design of many future space vehicles. An
overview of the current capabilities of CAT is provided by describing available methods and their applications. Technical
challenges that need to be met are also discussed.
INTRODUCTION
The design of the next-generation aerospace transportation systems will be driven
by considerations such as making systems fully reusable, achieving maximum
payload-to-total-weight ratios, and providing high-altitude aerodynamic maneuverability to make possible orbital-plane change and cross-range capability. These and
others considerations will be suitably refined to effect designs for economically feasible vehicles such as rapid-response transatmospheric vehicles (TAVs) and space
freighter vehicles like the aeroassisted orbital transfer vehicle (AOTV).2
In the past, heavy reliance was placed on using ground-based test facilities such as
shock tubes, arc jets, and ballistic ranges, in conjunction with engineering design
and analysis computer codes, to achieve closure on designs of such vehicles as the
Apollo Command Module, the Space Shuttle Orbiter, and the Galileo probe. Many
of these were expendable, "one-shot" vehicles that used ablative thermal protection systems (TPSs). The Space Shuttle Orbiter, a reusable nonaeromaneuvering
vehicle, is equipped with reusable tiles but must still undergo considerable refurbishment between missions. The design of fully reusable aeromaneuvering vehicles
will require that design tools be significantly improved over those used in the past,
and that design tolerances be much tighter to avoid unnecessary weight penalties
that can make the cost prohibitive.
Ground-based test facilities can provide valuable insight for the design and understanding of aerospace vehicles. Such facilities, however, cannot simulate all of the
conditions that will be encountered in missions planned for the future. Figure 1
shows the flight domain for a variety of aerospace vehicles for typical missions in
terms of flight Reynolds numbers and flight Mach numbers. Superimposed are the

regimes that can be simulated by typical ground-based test facilities. Unlike present
vehicles, those of the future will have t o endure extended periods of hypervelocity
flight at high altitudes,2 but this low-density flight regime is one of the most difficult
to simulate experimentally. Flight tests are being planned, such as the Aeroassist
Flight Experiment (AFE),3 to provide data for this regime, but such tests are expensive and can provide only a limited amount of data. To augment these data
and to optimize cost-effective designs, reliance must be placed on advanced computational techniques. Both ground-based and flight tests can provide valuable data
to validate these computational methods. The computational methods can then, in
turn, be used to extrapolate our understanding and analyses t o regimes not covered
by existing facilities.
Over the past 15 years, during the hiatus in hypersonic research, we have seen great
advances in three key areas that are now being synthesized t o develop computational
techniques that are sufficiently advanced to enable the design of the next-generation
aerospace transportation systems: (1) computers, (2) computational fluid dynamics
(CFD), and (3) computational aerothermodynamics (CAT). The first concerns the
development of inexpensive raw computing power. In the early 1970's scientific
computers were those in the IBM 360 and CDC 6600 class. The IBM 370 series and
the CDC 7600 machines were just becoming available. Since that time the Cray 1
and Cray 2 computers, the CDC Cyber 205, the Fujitsu VP200 and VP400, and the
Hitachi S 810 have become available. And in the future there will be the ETA 10
and the Cray 3 supercomputers. These later computers are faster and have larger
memories (by orders of magnitude) and, a t the same time, cost orders of magnitude
less per unit of computing power than did the computers of 15 years ago.
During the same period, a new and powerful aerodynamics tool was developed:
CFD. Numerical algorithms have been refined t o efficiently solve the Reynoldsaveraged Navier-Stokes equations for three-dimensional steady and unsteady compressible flows at transonic and supersonic speeds in an ideal gas. Associated with
this are sophisticated discretization schemes to describe complex geometries and
.~
flowfields. A recent survey of the state of the art in CFD is given by K ~ t l e r To
extend the CFD capability to the hypersonic flight regime experienced by aerospace
vehicles it is necessary t o include high temperature or, as it is commonly called,
real-gas effects. Typically, this involves the description of chemical reactions, thermochemical nonequilibrium, and radiative transport phenomena. At the very high
temperatures associated with high-altitude hypervelocity flight there is a paucity
of experimental data defining collision cross sections and transition probabilities
necessary t o accurately describe the chemical exchange processes involved; recent
advances in computational chemistry can be used t o fill this critical gap. A recent
survey describing the capability of computational chemistry and the effect on the
analysis of AOTVs is given by Cooper et al.5 The combination of CFD and the modeling of real-gas phenomena, along with modern high-speed computers, forms the
basis of CAT, which will be briefly described in the remainder of this paper, along
with some illustrative examples for particular methods and configurations. Excel2

lent recent review articles on CAT are given by Anderson,' Graves and Hunt,' and
Lewis.' These are highly recommended additional reading to augment the brief description given in this paper; in addition, they provide excellent lists of references
that describe the state of the art in even more detail.
The chief goal in CAT is to predict aerothermal flow environments. The physical phenomena involved include effects such as aerodynamic forces, convective and
radiative heating rates, gas and surface interactions and catalytic surfaces, interactions with active cooling TPSs, and plasma layers and their effect on communications and power supply. These phenomena are critical t o the design of maneuverable and aerodynamically stable vehicles that are adequately protected from the
very high thermal loads imposed by hypervelocity flight.
COMPUTATIONAL AEROTHERMODYNAMICS
CFD involves the numerical simulation of the equations of motion for an ideal gas;
as
these equations are the conservation of m s , momentum, and energy. In their
most general form these equations are the compressible Navier-Stokes(NS) equations. For turbulent flows the range of length scales is too great to be practically
resolved numerically; as a result, the equations are time-averaged over a scale small
with respect to the mean motion time-scale yet large with respect to the fine-scale
turbulent structure (see Ref. 9, for example). These small-scale turbulent transport processes are modeled using eddy-viscosity and eddy-conductivity approaches.
Many flowfields for a variety of shapes and flow conditions where strong viscousinviscid interactions or flow separation are important have been well simulated by
solving these equations in a time-like manner until a steady state is asymptotically
achieved. When there is no flow reversal and the inviscid flow in the streamwise
direction is supersonic, the steady-state NS equations can be simplified by neglecting the streamwise viscous terms and approximating the exact streamwise pressure
gradient. The solutions to these simplified equations, referred to as the parabolized
Xavier-Stokes equations( PNS), can be found by efficient streamwise-marching techniques. Further simplification can be achieved when viscous-inviscid interactions are
weak by decoupling the viscous- and inviscid-dominated regions from one another
and simulating the regions separately in an iterative manner. Here the unsteady,
S
inviscid N equations, termed the Euler(E) equations, are solved in the inviscid
region away from body surfaces. The asymptotic steady-state solution provides the
edge conditions needed for solution of the viscous-dominated boundary-layer(BL)
equations near the body surface. A fourth simplification which can be used for
strong viscous-inviscid interactions is the viscous shock-layer(VSL) approximation.
The VSL equations are obtained from the steady-state NS equations by retaining
terms up to second order in the inverse square root of the Reynolds number. In
addition, approximations are invoked for the normal pressure gradient and the bow
shock location. The reader is referred t o Ref. 9 for a comprehensive description of
the four equation sets corresponding to an ideal gas.
The four equation sets (Reynolds-averaged NS, PNS, E+BL, and VSL) when coupled with real-gas effects(to be discussed) form the basis of the solution methods

used in computational aerothermodynamics to simulate aerothermal environments
for a variety of vehicles and flight conditions. In this paper, the concern is solely
with continuum flow regimes; for methods used in computational aerothermodynamics for noncontinuum regimes (i.e., transitional and free-molecular regimes), it
is suggested that the reader see, for example, Ref. 10.
Real-gas effects include thermochemical nonequilibrium, where finite-rate processes
for chemical- and energy-exchange phenomena occur, and radiative transport. To
account for chemical reactions, conservation equations for each chemical species
must be added to the flowfield equation set. There are five flowfield equations:
a continuity equation, three momentum equations, and an energy equation. For
dissociating and ionizing air there are typically nine species ( N 2 , 02,N, 0 , NO,
O’, N + , NOS, e-). The inclusion of conservation equations for each of these
species nearly triples the number of equations to be solved. When there are combustion processes or gas-surface interactions or ablation products, the number of
species increases dramatically. To account for thermal nonequilibrium there are
additional energy equations t o describe the energy exchange between the various
energy modes (translational, rotational, vibrational, electronic, etc.). In Ref. 1 1 ,
conservation equations are presented for these nonequilibrium phenomena.They are
derived from kinetic principles and a four-component ionized gas consisting of neutral molecules, neutral atoms, singly ionized ions, and electrons. When thermal
radiation is important, the radiative flux must be included in the energy equation.
Computation of the radiation, based on realistic spectral models, is one of the most
costly parts of the solution process. To further complicate the analysis, the range
of time scales involved in thermochemical processes is many orders of magnitude
wider than the mean-flow time scale. This is the single most complicating factor
in CAT. A wide variety of simplifications are used to alleviate problems associated
with widely disparate time scales; they are discussed briefly next.
Many flows can be adequately approximated by assuming an equilibrium real gas.
Here, all the reaction rates are assumed to be fast enough so that the gas is everywhere in local equilibrium and the thermochemical state of the gas can be defined
solely by the local temperature and pressure. Reactions are allowed to occur but are
completely uncoupled from the flowfield equations. This is a good approximation
for lower altitudes and can be used for a major portion of the analysis of such vehicles as TAVs. At the other extreme, reactions are sometimes so slow that the gas
can be considered frozen in a particular chemical state. This phenomenon typically
occurs in regions of rapid expansion such as in jet or base flows, but can sometimes
be used behind compressive shocks as well.
When finite-rate chemical reactions are important, they can often be considered to
be in thermal equilibrium; that is, it can be assumed that the energy modes of the
species equilibrate very rapidly relative to the chemical rate processes. Even with
this simplification, the time scales vary over an extremely wide range, resulting
in a “stiff behavior of the complete equation set and adding to the difficulty in
solving the flowfield and species equations in a fully coupled manner. In these cases
4

the species equations are often effectively uncoupled from the flowfield equations
and solved separately in a “loosely” coupled manner, often by a different (typically
implicit) numerical technique.
STATUS O F CAT
This section presents an overview of the current capabilities of CAT. It describes,
in a general manner, the available methods and their applications to real-gas flows.
The particular methods and the applications to be described are representative of
the discipline and are those most familiar to the authors. A much more comprehensive list of available computer codes and references to their applications is provided
in Ref. 8. Most of the computer codes developed in CAT are based on the equation sets mentioned above. The codes will be described in a n order reversed from
that previously given for the equation sets. The new ordering somewhat follows the
chronological development of the four classes of codes.
Viscous Shock-Layer Codes
VSL codes have been the major tools for providing aerothermal flowfield environments for the windward forebody shock-layer region of reentry vehicles with simple
configurations. For instance, the axisymmetric HYVIS,I2 RASLE,13 and C0LTSl4
codes were used to define the predominately radiative heating environment of the
Galileo probe during its future entry into Jupiter’s atmosphere. The ablative TPS
for the probe was sized based on computer predictions. Lewis and his students have
developed several three-dimensional codes that include various real-gas effects(see
the reference list in Ref. 8).
A s a group, the VSL codes are, for multidimensional flow, the most robust as
far as simulating high-temperature phenomena is concerned. These phenomena
include equilibrium or nonequilibrium chemistry, binary or multicomponent diffusion, surface catalyticity, steady-state ablation, shock and wall slip, detailed spectral
radiation transport (employing a plane-slab approximation), and turbulence(eddyviscosity models). As an example of a recent application, Green et al.15 obtained
RASLE solutions for the forebody of a Titan atmosphere entry probe which is
planned to make scientific measurements in the organic haze layer of Saturn’s
largest moon. The flow was assumed t o be in thermochemical equilibrium and
corresponded to an entry velocity of 12 km/sec. Figure 2 shows the convective
and radiative stagnation-point heating pulses. The chemical species distribution
predicted along the stagnation streamline at peak heating are presented in Fig. 3.
The I’SL technique does have limitations. Since the VSL equations are hyperbolicparabolic in both the streamwise and crossflow directions, VSL codes cannot be
applied to flows with significant separation in those directions, or to flows with
large subsonic regions where upstream influence is important. Thus, they are most
attractive for simulating windward forebody flows for configurations that are neither
too slender nor too blunt.

Euler + Boundary-Layer Codes
T w o groups of researchers have successfully developed EI-BL solution methods. Ra-

kich and his colleagues'6~" have applied their method to the Space Shuttle Orbiter
flowfield. The analysis considers either equilibrium or nonequilibrium air chemistry,
and it has been used t o study the catalytic efficiency of the Orbiter's TPS. Hamilton
and his colleagues'* have also applied their method, which models equilibrium air
chemistry, to the Orbiter flowfield.

As an illustration of the E+BL technique, Fig. 4 (taken from Ref. 16) shows the
computed bow-shock shape (in the pitch plane of symmetry) over the Orbiter. The
flight conditions correspond t o a velocity of 6.7 km/s, an altitude of 65.5 km, and
an angle of attack of 30". The effect of reacting gas chemistry is clearly evident.

The E - B L method is useful for flows in which the inviscid-viscous interaction is
not significant and in which the BL assumptions are satisfied. One of the most
stringent assumptions is that the normal pressure gradient be negligible. It cannot
be applied to realistjcally simulate wake flows.
Parabolized Navier-Stokes Codes
To date, PES codes have been used mainly for slender-body, ideal-gas applications.
For blunted slender-body applications, an additional computation with a VSL or
KS code is necessary to provide a starting solution for the PNS solver. The starting
solution requires that the inviscid region of the flow be purely supersonic. Threedimensjonal PES codes for flows in chemical equilibrium have been developed by
Gnoff~,*~
Prabhu and Tannehill,20 and Balakrishnan.21 Gnoffo has studied flows
over bent-biconics configurations, and the others have performed numerical simulations on the Orbiter flowfield. Bhutta and Lewis' have developed axisymmetric
codes for air flows in chemical equilibrium or nonequilibrium.
The results of Ref. 20 exemplify the capabilities of the PKS technique. Figure 5
illustrates the Shuttle Orbiter geometry that was used in the numerical simulation,
and Fig. 6 shows a comparison of the surface heating along the windward centerline.
The flow conditions correspond to a point on the STS-3 trajectory at which the
velocity was 6.74 km/s, the altitude was 71.3 km, and the angle of attack was 40".
It is expected that the real-gas capabilities of the PNS codes will be greatly enhanced, a requisite for their use in the design of future slender-body vehicles like
the TAVs.
Kavier-Stokes Codes
Developing and applying NS codes that include realistic high-temperature effects is
certainly one of the most active areas in CAT and will remain so for many years to
come. These codes are needed to provide information for future vehicle design that
cannot be obtained by other techniques. A prime example is the simulation of the
wake-flow region of a n aerobraking AOTV. There are two general approaches, coming from opposite directions, that are being used to develop these codes. l n the first,
6

a simple one-dimensional fluid mechanical model is used, but it incorporates stateof-the-art real-gas modeling. This allows complex phenomena to be simulated and
compared with experiment for validating the models and the voluminous physical
property database. Moreover, it provides benchmark results so that approximate,
but usefully accurate, real-gas models can be developed. The approximate models
will be computationally more efficient, thus better suited to be coupled with multidimensional flow codes. In the other approach, sophisticated multidimensional
ideal-gas fluid codes form the base to which more established real-gas models are
coupled.
An example of the first approach is the work of Park who has led the development
of real-gas models for equilibrium and nonequilibrium chemistry, thermodynamics
(multitemperature models), and r a d i a t i ~ n . Gupta ~ Simmonds have st udjed
~ ~ ! ~ and
slip, multicomponent diffusion, and surface catalysis on a stagnation ~ t r e a m l i n e . ' ~
These kinds of basic studies are very important to the future development of CAT.
An example of results from the first approach (taken from Ref. 22) is presented in
Fig. 7, which shows the chemical and thermodynamic structure behind the shock
wave. The simulation corresponds to a shock-tube experiment with a freestream
velocity of 10 km/sec and a pressure of 13 P a (0.1 Torr). The nonequilibrium
thermodynamics is modeled by a two-temperature, dissociating, and ionizing air
model. By coupling a nonequilibrium radiation analysis23 to this flowfield, the
spectral emission is computed. In Fig. 8, the computed and measured spectra are
compared in detail. The good comparison validates the analysis.
There have many recent studies using the second approach. Balakrishnan and
D a ~ and Green2'j have extended ideal-gas NS codes for simulating hypersonic
y ~ ~
flows in chemical equilibrium. Balakrishnan and Davy applied their code to a threedimensional Orbiter flow. Green has performed axisymmetric validation simulations. Gnoffo and McCandless2' and Li2* have recently developed three-dimensional
NS solvers with models for both equilibrium and nonequilibrium air chemistry. Both
have done simulations for complete (forebody and wake) AOTV-type configurations.
As an illustration of the NS results, Fig. 9 (from Ref. 26) shows the molecular
nitrogen contours for a Mach 20 flow over a hemisphere at an altitude of 20 km.
The flow was assumed to be in thermochemical equilibrium. The upwind NS method
used here allows the hypersonic bow shock to be captured.
Although there is much more work to be done before multidimensional NS codes will
include all important high-temperature effects, progress is being made in bringing
the two approaches together.
FUTURE CHALLENGES IN CAT
In conclusion we will briefly comment on some of the challenges that lie ahead for
the CAT researchers. A review of the status of CAT clearly shows that one of the
biggest challenges is understanding how to couple nonequilibrium phenomena to
S
three-dimensional flowfield codes, especially the N codes. Coupling nonequilibrium chemistry to fluid codes needs more research on the optimum approach, but

7

most of the technical problems should be resolved in the near future. It is not clear
that the same holds true for nonequilibrium thermodynamics and radiation. Since
the only experience for these is the one-dimensional Row studies, not much can said
at this time. The very complicated problem of computing radiation transport in
the forebody and wake region of a vehicle like an AOTV is just beginning to be
addressed. Developing numerical boundary conditions that model realistic surface
effects like catalysis will also be a technical challenge. As the physical and chemical
models increase in sophistication, the amount of physical property data also increases. Data for the chemical, thermodynamic, and transport(inc1uding radiative
transport) models will be needed for high temperature gases, but such data are very
difficult t o obtain.
The development of hypersonic transitional and turbulence models for high
Reynolds-number flow regimes is a probably a problem equal in magnitude to that
of the problems associated with nonequilibrium phenomena mentioned above.
Advancements made in CFD must be incorporated into the CAT methods. As improved ideal-gas algorithms are developed, they must be extended to real-gas methods. The development of methods and data structures that are optimized for supercomputer processing are necessary for both disciplines. Effcient grid-generation
and solution-adaptive techniques will be necessary to optimize the use of memory
even on future supercomputers. Rapid advancements in computer graphics technology will be indispensable to the development and application of multidimensional
codes in CAT.
The last challenge t o be mentioned here is code validation, in which much work remains to be done. Many experiments have not been properly analyzed because the
codes have not modeled the necessary physics. For example, there are discrepancies between analysis and measurement in many of the previous flight experiments
that are not completely understood. Experiments with high-enthalpy flows, such
as arc-jet experiments, or with high Mach-number flows, such as shock-tube and
ballistic-range experiments, provide valuable real-gas data. But the numerical simulation of these experiments can be difficult, because of the sophisticated physical
modeling that must be included. The future(1992) AFE flight experiment mentioned previously will provide another important source for CAT code validation.
In the near future, as the modeling capabilities of real-gas computational methods
are improved, code validation will be a dominant area in CAT.

16. Abstract

Computational aerothermodynamics (CAT) has in the past contributed to the
understanding of real-gas flows encountered by hypervelocity reentry vehicles.
With advances in computational fluid dynamics, in the modeling of hightemperature phenomena, and in computer capability, CAT is an enabling technology
for the design of many future space vehicles. An overview of the current capabilities of CAT is provided by describing available methods and their applications. Technical challenges that need to be met are also discussed.
